Hello! 

This is a docker containerized app which will automatically water plants via a valve connected to pin 18 of a pi. I'm working on a branch where I'm adding a front end gui via web browser


DISCLAIMER: I'm fairly new to software scripting/coding, and wanted to learn how to develop containerized services and apps.
